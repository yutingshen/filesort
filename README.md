## Assumptions

Strings are alphanumeric meaning they contain only letters from a-z and A-Z and integers from 0-9.

Descending order is: 
- from z-a and 9-0
- from longer to shorter strings
- from alphanumerical values, to pure alphabetical strings, to integers. (e.g. a111 > 111a)
- is case-insensitive
